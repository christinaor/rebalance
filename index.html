        <!-- 1- Webpack emits relative links to built assets.
            2- When loading a page not directly under the root, built assets will fail to resolve, so a base must be specified so relative paths are resolved relative to the root.

            Notes:
            This also affects other paths across the app.
            Cannot change the path of bundle in webpack.
